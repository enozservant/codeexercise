# codeexercise 
For a coding exercise. Simply type "python [filename]" and it should run.

Q: "Is the way you wrote the second program influenced by writing the first?"

Yes because the two prompts were similar, but the datasets were different.
The first had missing data. To handle this, I filled in the missing data with a 0
to help with parsing the rest of the data in the dictionaries. The same with soccer. 
Because of the way that I parsed the first program, I did similarly for the second 
as I also used a similar technique.

I figured that the best runtime would be O(n) and so I did the work while iterating.
The second program did simiarly. But the first program takes longer than O(n) because
I iterate through each line to clean data.
