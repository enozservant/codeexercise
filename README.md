# codeexercise 
For a coding exercise. Simply type "python [filename]" and it should run.

Q: "Is the way you wrote the second program influenced by writing the first?"

Yes because the two prompts were similar. 
I figured that the best runtime would be O(n) and so I did the work while iterating.
The second program did simiarly.
